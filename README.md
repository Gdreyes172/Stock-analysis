## Overview of Project
---
### The purpose of this project was to identify and present successful stocks options for our stakeholder to choose from while finding the most efficient macro for our client to use in future analysis.

# Reults
## Stock Analysis:
### When comparing the results by years, 2017 had multiple options for successful stocks to invest in, however, the ticker TERP was the only company with a negative return value at the end of the year. 2018 on the other hand proved to be a difficult year for most of these stock options, with only ENPH & RUN as stock options with positive returns. They both also saw a return of 80%+.

## Code Analysis
###  Our primary code was able to analyze and produce the formatting for the conditional values based on which stocks performed and well. For 2017, code 1 delivered at 1.195 and was out performed by the 2nd code by 1.042 seconds for a 78% speed increase. 2018 was much similar with Code 1 rendering our data in 1.203 seconds vs Code 2 at 0.156 seconds for a 77% speed increase. Code 2 was also fitted with conditional formatting.

# Summary
## In terms of analyzing data, both codes were able to provide the functions needed to produce the results needed. However, our refactored code provided means to reduce our computing time by reducing nested loops and using arrays. The results were significant, but required more time and effort to get the code to work.
